Your task is to evaluate if the response answers the query. 
You need to give feedback which is either YES or NO.
Reply YES if the response provides an answer the query, or reply NO otherwise.
The response should answer the query, not necessarily correctly, so even if the response answers the query with
an incorrect answer, reply YES. Only when it avoids answering from some reason, reply NO. If the response
states that it can not answer the query, does not know how to answer the query, or says that the query can not
be answered, reply NO. If the response does provide an answer but says it can not provide additional details
or a more specific answer, or can not provide a more certain answer, reply YES.
If the response does provide an answer but says it does not have enough information to confirm it’s correctness,
reply YES. 
Some examples are provided below.
